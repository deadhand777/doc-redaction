The purpose of this project is to provide a service that automatically detects and redacts confidential information from documents.

---

### ðŸ“– Background

Contract management and document review are often **manual, non-standardized processes**. These workflows require expensive human resources, are error-prone, and lead to significant opportunity costs.

This service addresses these challenges by:

- **Automating manual review tasks** in seconds instead of hours or days
- **Standardizing the output**, ensuring reliability and transparency
- **Reducing human error** and increasing efficiency in compliance workflows

---

### ðŸš€ Features

- **Content extraction**
  Extracts text, structure, and embedded elements from documents or images using language models with vision capabilities

- **Content transformation**
  Converts unstructured content into LLM-friendly formats

- **Sensitive information detection**
  Identifies and classifies sensitive data such as:
  - Business-sensitive information
  - Personal data (PII)
  - Financial details
  - Legal obligations

- **Automated redaction**
  Transforms documents into **PII-compliant, shareable versions** by redacting confidential content

- **Knowledge base integration**
  Creates reusable, structured knowledge base content

- **Human-in-the-loop**
  Supports optional manual review and approval to ensure compliance

## Getting started

Please visit the [Getting Started Section](https://deadhand777.github.io/doc-redaction/getting-started/) within the project documentation. Step-by-step guidance is provided there.

## How does it work

The service is a **agentic system** composed of a **multi-step workflow**.
